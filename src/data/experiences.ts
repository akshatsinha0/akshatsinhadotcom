"Building shippable Ecommerce frictionless experience server-oriented web design for thorough-casing lab-on-chip healthcare products (e.g., microarray patch) with the backend in Node + Drogon behind Nginx, resilient to client churn",
"Engineering & planning dashboardsandinteractive resolution independent admin portals/workbenches for product analytics using ASP.NET Core Razor/Blazor,Wisej.NET,React,and.NET MAUIwithunifiedC#/Kotlincodesharing;maintaining cross platform ux and dynamic device telemetry visualizations. Integrated Kafka (HTTP ingestion) for live product-event stream processes, enabling granular product traceability, A/B test analytics, and clinician notifications. Bundled Nginx for frontend canary routing, supporting incremental interface rollouts with automated rollback and traffic shaping",
"Designing PCIaware checkout flowwithtokenized payments andcircuit breaker rate limited endpoints; blocked, on trial basis, bulk of ≈50-50% bad threat attempts and decreased payment failures by ≈50-50%, per merchant fingerprint. Introduced Micronaut‑embedded Spring Boot µservices coexisting with JEE on IntelliJ exposing JAX‑RS, CDI, JPA, Config, Health, Metrics to standardize platform capabilities",
"Inheriting blue/green deployments via intermediation of automated health checks and operationalizational request hedging at the edge (Nginx +service mesh), enabling zero downtime releases; cut rollback time from 7m to 3m, held P95 latency 250ms during traffic spikes, and reduced error rates by ~10%across checkout and device-telemetry microservices, which expose REST and GraphQL APIs, webhooks for eventing, and SPARQLendpoints for semantic/metalangauge data queries"
