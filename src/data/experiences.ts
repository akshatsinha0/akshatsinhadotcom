"Building shippable Ecommerce frictionless experience server-oriented web design for thorough-casing lab-on chip healthcare products (e.g., microarray patch) with the backend in Node + Drogon behind Nginx",
"Engineering & planning dashboards and interactive resolution independent admin portals for product analytics using ASP.NET Core Razor/Blazor, Wisej.NET 4.0, React, and .NET MAUI with unified C#/Kotlin code sharing; maintaining cross-platform user experiences and dynamic device telemetry visualizations. Integrated Kafka (with HTTP ingestion) for live product-event streams, enabling granular product traceability, A/B test analytics, and clinician notifications. Bundled Nginx for frontend canary routing, supporting incremental interface rollouts with automated rollback and traffic shaping",
"Designing PCI-aware checkout flow with tokenized payments and rate-limited endpoints; blocked, on trial basis, bulk of 50–50% bad threat attempts and decreased payment failures by 50–50%",
"Inheriting blue/green deployments via intermediation of automated health checks and request hedging at the edge (Nginx + service mesh), enabling zero-downtime releases; cut rollback time from 7m to 3m, held P95 latency ≤ 250ms during traffic spikes, and reduced error rates by ∼10% across checkout and device-telemetry microservices, which expose REST and GraphQL APIs, webhooks for eventing, and SPARQL endpoints for semantic/metalanguage data queries"
